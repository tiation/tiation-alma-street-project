# Version Control Implementation

## Purpose
This document outlines how to implement version control for Tia's case documentation. Version control will help maintain the integrity of the documentation, track changes over time, and provide an additional layer of evidence regarding when information was recorded.

## Git Version Control System

### Initial Setup
1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   cd /home/lappy/Documents/Tia_Incidents
   git init
   ```

2. **Create .gitignore File**
   Create a file named `.gitignore` to exclude any sensitive files that should not be tracked:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
   Add patterns for files to ignore, such as temporary files or files containing passwords.

3. **Initial Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial documentation setup"
   ```

### Regular Usage

#### Making Changes
1. **Document Creation/Modification**
   - Create or update documentation files as events occur
   - Be sure to save all changes

2. **Commit Changes**
   After creating or updating documentation:
   ```bash
   git add [filename]  # For specific files
   # OR
   git add .  # For all changes

   git commit -m "Descriptive message about the changes"
   ```
   - Include meaningful commit messages that describe what was added or changed
   - Example: `git commit -m "Add incident report for May 26 gym access denial"`

#### Best Practices
1. **Commit Frequently**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Commit after each significant addition or change
   - This creates a detailed history of how the documentation evolved

2. **Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Begin with a verb (Add, Update, Document, etc.)
   - Clearly describe what changed
   - Include references to dates, people, or incidents when relevant

3. **Review Changes Before Committing**
   ```bash
   git diff  # Shows changes not yet staged
   git diff --staged  # Shows changes that are staged for commit
   ```

4. **Check Status Regularly**
   ```bash
   git status  # Shows which files have been modified
   ```

### Backup and Collaboration

#### Creating Backups
1. **Local Backup**
   ```bash
   git bundle create tia-case-backup.bundle --all
   ```
   This creates a single file containing the entire Git repository, which can be stored on external media.

2. **Remote Repository** (if appropriate and secure)
   - Consider setting up a private remote repository
   - Ensure any remote storage is secure and confidential

#### Collaboration (if multiple people are documenting)
1. **Establish Branch Strategy**
   - Main branch contains verified documentation
   - Create feature branches for new documentation
   - Merge after review

2. **Pull Before Push**
   ```bash
   git pull  # Get latest changes before adding new ones
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts Carefully**
   - If multiple people edit the same file, resolve conflicts thoughtfully
   - Ensure no information is lost during conflict resolution

## Documentation Integrity

### Timestamps and Proof
1. **Commit Timestamps**
   Git automatically records when each commit was made, providing a timestamp for when documentation was created or modified.

2. **Author Information**
   Configure Git to use accurate information:
   ```bash
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "tiatheone@protonmail.com"
   ```

3. **Commit Signatures** (optional)
   For additional verification, consider signing commits:
   ```bash
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```
   (Requires GPG setup)

### Maintaining Chain of Custody
1. **Access Control**
   - Limit who has write access to the repository
   - Document who made changes when multiple people are involved

2. **No History Rewriting**
   Avoid commands that alter history:
   - No `git rebase` on committed documentation
   - No `git commit --amend` on committed documentation
   - No `git push --force`

3. **Log Review**
   Periodically review the commit history:
   ```bash
   git log  # View commit history
   git log --stat  # View files changed in each commit
   ```

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate (24-48 Hours)**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create initial commit of all documentation
   - Configure user information

2. **Short-Term (Next Week)**
   - Establish commit routine
   - Create first backup bundle
   - Train any additional documentation contributors

3. **Ongoing**
   - Commit all changes promptly
   - Create regular backups
   - Review commit history monthly
